I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file for you at `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This file will define the automated CI/CD pipeline for your project.

First, let me check if the directory structure exists:

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

I need to create the `.github/workflows` directory structure first, and then create the `main.yml` file. Let me create a GitHub Actions workflow file that will build and test your React weather application:

```diff
- 
+ name: React Weather App CI/CD
+ 
+ on:
+   push:
+     branches: [ main ]
+   pull_request:
+     branches: [ main ]
+ 
+ jobs:
+   build-and-test:
+     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+ 
+     strategy:
+       matrix:
+         node-version: [16.x, 18.x]
+ 
+     steps:
+     - uses: actions/checkout@v3
+     
+     - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
+       uses: actions/setup-node@v3
+       with:
+         node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
+         cache: 'npm'
+     
+     - name: Install dependencies
+       run: npm ci
+     
+     - name: Build
+       run: npm run build
+     
+     - name: Test
+       run: npm test
+       
+     - name: Lint
+       run: npm run lint
+       if: ${{ always() }} 
```

I've created a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This workflow will:

1. Trigger on pushes and pull requests to the main branch
2. Run on Ubuntu latest
3. Test with both Node.js 16.x and 18.x versions
4. Perform the following steps:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies using `npm ci` (clean install)
   - Build the application
   - Run tests
   - Run linting (this will run even if previous steps fail)

This is a standard CI/CD workflow for a React application. It ensures that your code builds correctly, passes tests, and meets linting standards before being merged into the main branch.

If you need to customize this workflow further, such as adding deployment steps or adjusting the Node.js versions, please let me know!
